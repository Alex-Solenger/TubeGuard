# TubeGuard ‚Äî Smart Startup Protection for Tube Amplifiers

![TubeGuard Banner](./images/tubeguard-banner.jpg)

**TubeGuard** is a smart soft-start and high-voltage delay module for Hi-End vacuum tube amplifiers. Designed for audiophiles, DIY builders, and small amp manufacturers, it protects expensive output tubes from premature wear due to cold starts.

## üéØ What Does It Do?

‚úîÔ∏è Delays high-voltage (B+) activation until cathode heaters reach nominal temperature  
‚úîÔ∏è Soft ramp-up of heater voltage to reduce thermal shock  
‚úîÔ∏è Extends tube life by reducing cathode stripping  
‚úîÔ∏è Compact design ‚Äî integrates easily into existing amplifiers  
‚úîÔ∏è Compatible with EL34, KT88, 6L6, and most common tubes

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

When the amplifier is powered on:

1. Tube heaters receive gradually increasing voltage (ramp-up phase)
2. After a defined warm-up delay (e.g., 70 seconds), B+ (anode voltage) is enabled
3. An opto-isolated relay or SSR safely applies anode voltage
4. The device ensures correct startup sequencing every time
